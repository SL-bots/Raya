Classic filters are just like marie's filter system. If you still like that kind of filter system
**Admin Only**
 - /cfilter <word> <message>: Every time someone says "word", the bot will reply with "message"
You can also include buttons in filters, example send `/savefilter google` in reply to `Click Here To Open Google | [Button.url('Google', 'google.com')]`
 - /stopcfilter <word>: Stop that filter.
 - /stopallcfilters: Delete all filters in the current chat.
**Admin+Non-Admin**
 - /cfilters: List all active filters in the chat
 
 **Please note classic filters can be unstable. We recommend you to use /addfilter**
